        <p class="tieude2">Education and early life</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Wilson was born on May 16, 1937, in Geneva, Nebraska. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska and 
          earned a full scholarship to Harvard University. He received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1959. He then completed his M.B.A. in
           1961 and his D.B.A. in 1963 from the Harvard Business School. He worked at the University of California, Los Angeles for a very
            brief time and then joined the faculty at Stanford University. He has been on the faculty of the Stanford Business School since 
            1964. He was also an affiliated faculty member of Harvard Law School from 1993 to 2001.</p>

        <p class="tieude2">Work</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Humans have been selling things to the highest bidder or buying things from the cheapest source for thousands of years. These days, goods and services change hands for astronomical values at auctions daily. Robert Wilson and Paul Milgrom have studied how auctions work. They have also translated their theories into practice and created new auctions for goods and services that are difficult to sell through traditional means, such as radio frequencies. Their discoveries have benefited sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world.</p>

        <a href=""><img class="sully2" src="/Kinhte/nobel1.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <p class="ttchinh">Wilson is known for research and teaching on market design, pricing, negotiation, and related topics concerning 
          industrial organization and information economics. He is an expert on game theory and its applications. He has been a major 
          contributor to auction designs and competitive bidding strategies in the oil, communication, and power industries, and to the 
          design of innovative pricing schemes. His work on pricing of priority service for electric power has been implemented in the 
          utility industry.</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Wilson's 1968 Econometrica paper The Theory of the Syndicates influenced a whole generation of economics, finance,
          and accounting students. The paper poses a fundamental question: Under what conditions does the expected utility representation 
          describe the behavior of a group of individuals who choose lotteries and share risk in a Pareto-optimal way?</p>
            <p class="ttchinh">He has published about a hundred articles in professional journals and books since completing his education. He has been
              an associate editor of several journals, and delivered several public lectures.</p>
            <p class="ttchinh">In 1993, Wilson published a book on Nonlinear Pricing. It is an encyclopedic analysis of tariff design and related 
              topics for public utilities, including power, communications, and transport. The book won the 1995 Leo Melamed Prize, a prize 
              awarded biannually by the University of Chicago for "outstanding scholarship by a business professor."</p>  
            <p class="ttchinh">Other contributions to game theory includes wage bargaining and strikes, and in legal contexts, settlement 
              negotiations. He has authored some of the basic studies of reputational effects in predatory pricing, price wars, and other 
              competitive battles.</p>

        <p class="tieude2">Awards and honours</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a designated 'distinguished fellow' of the American Economic
          Association, and a fellow, former officer and Council member of the Econometric Society. He was conferred an honorary Doctor of Economics 
          degree in 1986 by the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. In 1995, he was conferred an honorary Doctor of 
          Laws degree by the University of Chicago. In 2014, Wilson won a Golden Goose Award for his work involving auction design.</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">He has won the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2015) in the Economics, Finance and Management category for 
          his "pioneering contributions to the analysis of strategic interactions when economic agents have limited and different information about 
          their environment". With colleagues David M. Kreps and Paul Milgrom, he was awarded the 2018 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of 
          Science.</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Wilson and Paul Milgrom as the co-recipients of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize
          in Economics for having "improved auction theory and invented new auction formats, beneftting sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the
          world".</p>
