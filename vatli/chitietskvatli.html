    <p class="tieudechung">SUMMARY</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The results of their independent research paved the way for a quantum information revolution leading to new technologies such as quantum computers, quantum telecommunications, and the quantum Internet." Alain Aspect (75 years old, French), John F. Clauser (79 years old, USA) and Anton Zeilinger (77 years old, Austria) when honoring their experimental work in the field of quantum physics with the Nobel Prize. physics 2022.Three physicists have conducted experiments to verify the "quantum entanglement" effect (also called "quantum entanglement"), a hypothesis of quantum mechanics that has caused much controversy in the scientific world.

    <p class="tieudechung">Einstein didn't believe it either



    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Albert Einstein once derisively called this effect the "monstrous act of being far apart" of microscopic particles (small particles in the atomic world). As one of the founders of quantum mechanics, Einstein later expressed great skepticism, even rejecting quantum theory because it was not a complete theory. He said of this theory: "God does not play games of chance with the universe".However, quantum mechanics has not only become the scientific foundation that explains the basic nature of nature, but also has extremely important applications in daily life. A few specific examples are transistors and semiconductor chips, considered to be the nervous system that controls electronics from smartphones to spaceships, both inventions based on the understanding and application of quantum mechanics.The experimental verification of the "quantum entanglement" effect not only confirms the correctness of quantum theory, but also has important applications in the development of quantum computers and telecommunications - key areas of quantum computing. The quantum information revolution is taking place at breakneck speed and investments are billions of dollars annually worldwide.</p>

    <p class="tieudechung">How to paint burdock is real?

    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">In the early decades of the 20th century, a time often referred to as the second scientific revolution, physicists were trying to understand the properties and behavior of particles in the microscopic world. A series of laws of quantum mechanics are very abstract and puzzling, many of the properties of microscopic particles are even contrary to common sense. </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Among them is a peculiar phenomenon called the "quantum entanglement" effect. (Personally, the writer of this article prefers to translate the term as "quantum complex relation".)    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Techniques such as "how to paint the oxen", "six veins of the divine sword", "Nhat yang chi"... as in Kim Dung's swordplay are also completely realistic, if one can master the quantum interactions. The "quantum entanglement" effect is therefore controversial. Even the announcement of the Nobel Committee wrote that this effect "goes against conventional ideas of cause and effect...".

    <p class="tieudechung">New antiviral treatments</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The seminal discovery of HCV by this year’s Nobel Laureates paved the way for the development of effective antiviral drugs. While infectious in primates, the full-length clones generated by Rice exhibited poor replicative capacity in cell lines, which hampered in vitro studies of the virus life cycle and testing of candidate antiviral drugs. This obstacle was overcome thanks the work of Ralph Bartenschlager at the University of Heidelberg in Germany who constructed the first HCV sub-genomic clones that replicated with high efficiency in transfected hepatoma cell lines. Further improvement of the technology, and the identification of virus isolates that could replicate in cell lines without the need for adaptive mutations, led to the production of sub-genomic replicons that upon transfection into hepatoma cells resulted in the secretion of virus particles that were infectious. The second obstacle stems from the very restricted host spectrum of HCV – the virus infects only humans and chimpanzees – and the consequent lack of a small animal models for precise assessment of the pathological and immunological profile of the disease, and for pre-clinical testing of candidate drugs. Progress was made when T- and B-cell deficient mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) could be grafted with human hepatocytes and other models were developed.</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The availability of in vitro replication systems and the development of small animal models for in vivo studies facilitated the development of highly effective antiviral drugs that have revolutionized the treatment of HCV infection. Earlier therapeutic regiments, including recombinant type I interferon (IFN) and the nucleoside analog ribavirin, were ineffective and associated with significant side effects. Some improvement was made at the end of the 1990s with the introduction of pegylated-IFN and further improvements were made with the introduction of inhibitors of the NS3/NS4A protease, such a beceprevir, teleprevir and sime-previr. The development of drugs that specifically target the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, e.g. sofosbuvir, and the regulatory replicon protein NS5A, e.g. ledipasvir, constituted major breakthroughs in HCV therapeutics. The combination of drugs that target critical viral functions, collectively known as directly acting antivirals (DAAs), proved to be highly effective, caused only minor side effects and strongly diminished the risk of selecting drug resistant variants of the virus.</p>
    <p class="tieudechung">How is hepatitis C detected  ?</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Before the hepatitis C virus was discovered, scientists knew about the hepatitis A and B viruses. However, the causative agent of most blood-borne chronic hepatitis cases was still a mystery at that time. number. 

      The researches of Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice helped to detect the hepatitis C virus, which is the most common blood-borne chronic hepatitis virus in the world.
      
      By identifying the hepatitis C virus as the real causative agent of chronic hepatitis, scientists have a basis for finding accurate diagnostic methods as well as effective and life-saving treatments. millions of people around the world.
      
      Hepatitis is a chronic inflammation of the liver caused mainly by viruses. In 1940, two groups of hepatitis were identified. Hepatitis A is mainly transmitted through food and drink and usually does not leave long-term consequences for the patient. Meanwhile, the second type (hepatitis B) is transmitted through blood and body fluids, causing long-term and dangerous consequences such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.
      
      The disease can persist for years without the person knowing it, until severe symptoms appear. This blood-borne hepatitis causes more than 1 million deaths a year worldwide, making it as impactful as tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.
      
      The first important step took place in the 1960s, when Baruch Blumberg (Nobel Biomedical Sciences 1976) discovered the virus that causes hepatitis B. However, there are still many cases of chronic hepatitis without No specific cause could be found.
      
      Harvey J. Alter, at the National Institutes of Health, was studying patients who developed hepatitis after a blood transfusion. He realized that the blood of these patients could transmit hepatitis to chimpanzees. 
      
      Later studies by him and his colleagues proved that the causative agent of this hepatitis was not caused by hepatitis A or B viruses, two viruses that were found at that time. This demonstrates that there is an unknown pathogen that causes blood-borne hepatitis.
      
      The next breakthrough was made by Michael Houghton, when he found a way to isolate this mysterious virus. He and his colleagues identified virus-specific genetic material in the blood of infected people. Subsequent studies also identified specific antibodies to this virus in patients with chronic hepatitis. The virus was then named hepatitis C virus</p>

  <p class="tieudechung">Help to cure completely</p>
  <p class="ttchinh">Building on the findings of Harvey Alter and Michael Houghton, Charles M. Rice and colleagues at Washington University St. Louis studied how the hepatitis C virus reproduces and proved that this virus is the cause of the blood-borne hepatitis C virus.

    The identification of hepatitis C virus is a turning point for the fight against hepatitis in particular and diseases caused by viruses in general.
    
    Through the contributions of Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice, medicine has found a way to detect hepatitis C virus in blood samples and prevent transmission through blood transfusion.
    
    The findings of these three scientists also guide the creation of specific treatments that target the virus and completely cure hepatitis C.
    
    Although it is still necessary to solve the remaining two difficult problems, how to make diagnostic tests for hepatitis C virus and hepatitis C antiviral drugs become popular, especially in developing countries, but people are standing still. before the opportunity can completely eliminate hepatitis C virus.
    
    Three scientists Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice will equally share the prize money of more than 1 million USD for the annual Nobel Prize in biomedical science.</p>
