        <p class="tieude2">Education and early life</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Alter was born to Jewish parents and was raised in New York City. He earned a bachelor’s degree (1956) and a medical
          degree (1960) from the University of Rochester. He remained there at Strong Memorial Hospital as a resident before transferring to
           Bethesda, Maryland, to work in the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Following a yearlong residency 
           (1964–65) at the University of Washington in Seattle, Alter worked as a fellow in hematology (1965–66) at Georgetown University 
           Hospital in Washington, D.C. He subsequently served as director of hematology research (1966–69) at Georgetown. In 1969 Alter 
           returned to the NIH, joining the Department of Transfusion Medicine as a senior investigator, a position he held for the remainder 
           of his career. In 1972 he became chief of the infectious diseases section and in 1987 associate director for research at the NIH 
           Clinical Center, posts that he also maintained for the duration of his career.</p>

        <p class="ttchinh">Hepatitis is a group of diseases that cause inflammation of the liver. It can be caused by different viruses that are transmitted through blood. In the 1970s, two types of hepatitis, A and B, had been identified. Studies of people who had received blood transfusions allowed Harvey Alter and his colleagues to demonstrate that a previously unknown contagion also transmitted hepatitis. They were also able to show that this contagion was a virus. The finding was an important step in developing blood tests and new medications that have saved millions of lives.</p>

        <p class="ttchinh">Alter’s first major breakthrough came in the early 1960s while working at NIH, when he and American research 
          physician Baruch S. Blumberg discovered the so-called Australia antigen. The researchers observed the antigen in the blood from 
          an Australian aborigine and detected it in about 11 percent of American leukemia patients and in only a very small percentage of 
          healthy Americans. The protein was subsequently identified as a surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Alter helped develop an 
          assay to detect the antigen, named HBsAg, in donor blood. The later development of a highly sensitive method of HBsAg detection in
           donor blood led to a dramatic decrease in transfusion-associated hepatitis (TAH).</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">In 1970s Alter and colleagues, during investigations of patients who developed TAH found that some patients 
          were not positive for antigens to HBV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), or other viruses associated with the condition. Further studies, 
          in which chimpanzees inoculated with non-A, non-B human plasma or serum developed hepatitis, led the researchers to conclude that
           a third transmissible agent was capable of causing TAH. In the mid-1980s Alter urged blood banks to test donor blood for hepatitis
            B core antibody (anti-HBc), which served as a surrogate marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. Subsequent introduction of 
            anti-HBc testing was associated with a further decline in TAH incidence to about 4 percent.</p>
            <p class="ttchinh">In 1989 Houghton and colleagues reported the isolation of a complementary DNA clone derived from the RNA genome of 
              the non-A, non-B hepatitis agent. Later that year Alter and Houghton jointly reported the detection of HCV in transfusion patients
               who developed non-A, non-B hepatitis. In 1990 an assay for anti-HCV testing of donor blood was introduced, further reducing TAH
                incidence to just 1 percent. The later development of more sensitive assays led to the near elimination of TAH.</p>

        <p class="tieude2">Awards and honours</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Alter has received recognition for his research including the 2000 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical 
          Research for his work leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C. Alter and his co-awardee Michael Houghton 
          were recognized for the development of blood screening methods that essentially eliminated the risk of transfusion-associated 
          hepatitis in the U.S. Other honors for his medical research include the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award conferred 
          to civilians in United States government public health service. Alter has been elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and 
          the Institute of Medicine. In 2002 he received The International Society of Blood Transfusion Presidential Award. In 2005, he received the 
          American College of Physicians Award for Outstanding Work in Science as Related to Medicine, and the First International Prize of Inserm
           (the French equivalent of NIH). And in 2019, he's nominated for T. Washington Fellows.</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Speaking of Alter's long research career at the time of the 2000 Lasker Award, Harvey Klein, chief of the Clinical 
          Center Transfusion Medicine Department noted, "As a young research fellow, Dr. Alter co-discovered the Australia antigen, a key to 
          detecting Hepatitis B virus. For many investigators that would be the highlight of a career. For Dr. Alter it was only an auspicious 
          beginning".</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Alter was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine alongside Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice 
          for "discoveries that led to the identification of Hepatitis C virus".</p>
